Changes made based on lecturer feedback
Based on the feedback I got I improved error handling by increasing the amount that I used and made sure that they worked. Improved coding standards by sperating lines so that it looks neater, added more meaningful comments. I also made two exstra classes instead of having just one. These three classes are used for one to store the details of the recipe in list, one to handle the input of recipes and the last class is to handle all the other methods that are required from the system.

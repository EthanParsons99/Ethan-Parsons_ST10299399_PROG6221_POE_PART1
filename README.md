Recipe App - Part 1
This project will be submitted as a zip file. You will need to open the zip file and extract all the files and open it in visual studio 2022. After that you just need to run the project and follow the instructions. The goal of part one for this project is to allow a user to be able to enter one recipe. The user can then manage or print out their recipe that they have entered in a neat format.

Features
Some of the features that this part of the project includes you to do are: 
•	Enter a new recipe.
•	Scale ingredient quantities.
•	Reset ingredient quantities to original values.
•	Clear the recipe.
•	Print out a neat display of entered recipe.
•	Exit the application.

How the project works
1.	Run the project to start the application.
2.	The user will then get prompted with a menu in which they would need to enter a number for the option they would like to do.
3.	The only option that will work at the start of the project is to enter a recipe or exit the application.
4.	After the user picks to enter a new recipe, the user will then need to enter the recipes name, ingredients and steps.
5.	After they have entered the recipe, they will be able to use the other features like scaling and clearing the recipe. They will also be able to print out the recipe or after it’s been scaled the scaled recipe. 
6.	If the user has chosen to scale the recipe the will be able to use the reset feature to display the original recipe, if they use it before scaling it is just going to print out the same recipe.
7.	After each feature is done or used the user will get taken back to the menu where they can exit and close the application.

This is what my part one of the project can do.
